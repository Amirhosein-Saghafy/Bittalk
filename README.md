Details: 
Bittalk is a social network. 
In this project, an attempt has been made to simulate the user experience of different social networks such as X, Instagram and LinkedIn to a significant extent. 
This project was a great challenge for me to measure my skills and improve them. Users can send connection requests to each other, like and save each other's posts, edit their profiles, search and explore among other users.
In this web application, users can customize it to a great extent and choose the model they want among different themes and colors.

Usage:
1- Run 'npm i' for installing the node_modules files
2- Run 'npm start' for running the project with cra template
